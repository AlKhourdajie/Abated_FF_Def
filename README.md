# Introduction
This repository includes the visualisation code for Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the paper that establishes criteria for 'abated' fossil fuel and industrial process emissions. The paper proposes four key benchmark criteria:
1) CO₂ capture rates of ≥95%
2) Permanent storage of captured emissions
3) Reducing upstream and end-use fugitive methane emissions to ≤0.5% (targeting 0.2%)
4) Counterbalancing remaining emissions using permanent carbon dioxide removal

# Figures
Figure 1: Primary energy coal and gas use with and without CCS from global modelled pathways submitted to the IPCC AR6 scenarios database.

Figure 2: Emissions reduction potential in industrial sectors (steel and cement) through methane leakage control and carbon capture and storage.

# Data 
Figure 1 is based on data from the IPCC AR6 Scenarios Database:

Figure 2 is based on calculations of emissions from steel and cement production using data from:
- IEA (2022). Global Methane Tracker
- Wang et al. (2021). Efficiency stagnation in global steel production. Nature Communications
- Nduagu et al. (2022). Comparative life cycle assessment of natural gas and coal-based DRI production
